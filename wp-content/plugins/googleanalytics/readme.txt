Use Google Analytics on your Wordpress site without touching any code, and view visitor reports right in your Wordpress admin dashboard!

== Description ==

Monitor, analyze, and measure visitor engagement for your site directly from your WordPress dashboard with our Google Analytics plugin. With our Google Analytics dashboard, you’ll be able to conveniently access Google Analytics reports in the same interface you already use every day to write and manage your posts.

Unlike other plugins, there are no monthly fees or paid upgrades for this plugin. All of the features are 100% free.

**GOOGLE ANALYTICS SETUP**

Get started in less than 10 minutes. Installation is quick and easy, no developers required.

Simply download the plugin, log into Google, select the required website, and it will automatically include the appropriate code.

**GOOGLE ANALYTICS DASHBOARD**

Start making data-driven decisions with real time stats including:

* Visitor trends – Dive deeper into your website’s page views, users, pages per session, and bounce rate for the past 7 days as compared to the previous 7 days
* Traffic sources – Discover which 5 traffic sources are driving the most visitors to your website
* Top pages – Stay updated on your 10 most viewed pages

With our mobile-optimized plugin, you’ll be able to stay informed and get actionable insights on any device. For more accurate stats, you also have the option to disable tracking for any role like Admins or Editors so your analytics represent real visitors.

== Installation ==

1. Install Google Analytics either via WordPress.org plugin repository or directly by uploading the files to your server
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in your WordPress dashboard
3. Navigate to Google Analytics in the WordPress sidebar
4. Authenticate via Google, copy and paste the access code and choose your property from the dropdown. You can also add the web property ID from Google Analytics manually but dashboards won't show up in this case.
5. When any of your content takes off you will see the URLs inside the Trending Content section

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why do I need an SSL certificate to use this plugin? =
Since the plugin accesses your Google Analytics account your login information is transerfered from our plugin to google.  This needs to be secure so SSL is required to keep your information safe.

= Do I need to touch any code to add Google Analytics? =
Nope, just sign in with google, choose your website, and our plugin will automatically add Google analytics code to all pages.

= How do I make sure Google Analytics is properly installed on all pages? =
If you signed it with google and selected your website (or manually added the property ID) the Google Analytics javascript will be added to all pages. To check what UA code it is adding, just open any page of your website in Chrome, right click to select Inspect, navigate to Network tab, reload the page and search for googleanalytics, you will see the google code with your UA ID. <a href=”https://cl.ly/1q3o2q26261V/[e5b08a5ae1c09684a56ba14c36e6fa5c]_Screen%2520Shot%25202017-02-06%2520at%25201.57.34%2520PM.png” title=”Google Analytics code on the page example”>See example here.</a>

= I see broken formatting inside the plugin, for example some buttons are not aligned? =
This is likely caused by AdBlocker that is blocking anything related to "google analytics". Please disable AdBlocker for your own website or add it to exceptions if you are using Opera.

= How does that cool "Trending Content" feature work? =
It learns about your traffic patterns to spot "spikes" of visitors and then sends an alert. If your website doesn't have good amount of visitors you might not see any Trending Content Alerts because the algorithm needs more data to see "trends".

= I have other questions, where I can get support or provide feedback? =
If you have any questions please let us know directly at support@sharethis.com or create a new ticket within our WP support portal.
We are always happy to help.
